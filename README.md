# How to Deploy a Keras Model to Production

The project has 2 objectives:-
1. Train an [EMNIST classifier](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist)
2. Build and host a web app which takes user input in live handwriting characters and tells what character is the user writing.

## Dataset

train = [emnist-balanced-train.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist/downloads/emnist-balanced-train.csv/3)
test = [emnist-balanced-test.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist/downloads/emnist-balanced-test.csv/3)

## Dependencies (Python 3.6)

```sudo pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Run the app

```python app.py```
